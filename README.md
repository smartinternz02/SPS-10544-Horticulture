<h1> Project Title </h1> <br>
<h3>HORTICULTURE - ANALYSIS OF AREA PRODUCTION AND PRODUCTIVITY OF SPICES FROM 2008 â€“ 2011</h2> <br>
<h1> Project Description </h1> <br>
<p> Horticulture is the art of cultivating plants in gardens to produce food and medicinal ingredients, or for comfort and ornamental purposes. Horticulturists grow flowers, spices, fruits and nuts, vegetables and herbs, as well as ornamental trees and lawns. In this project, I am going to analyse the area production and productivity of spices from 2008 - 2011 data and make a storyboard report using Tableau to understand the production and productivity of spices effectively. The dataset downloaded from data.gov.in website. The dataset contains the data about the area production and productivity of spices from 2008 - 2011.
